        <h1>Enzyme Time! WebQuest and Video Game</h1>
        <h2>Adapted from Ana Ulrich</h2>
        <h5>Note: when you click a link scroll down to the bottom to view it if it does not like you and doesent open then go to back to the link and right click and open in a new tab, window ,or inconito window </h5>
        <p><strong>Prior Knowledge:</strong> In this lesson, you will discover how enzymes help our bodies to break down or build up a specific substrate and catalyze chemical reactions. You will learn how pH, temperature, and concentration affect the rate of chemical reactions in our bodies and will experiment using graphs and interactive games to learn and check your understanding of enzymes.</p>
        <p><strong>Put your answers in a different color, please!</strong></p>
        
        <h3>Learning Targets:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I can use a model to illustrate the 3-D structure of a protein and relate that structure to the biological function of an enzyme.</li>
            <li>I can compare the activation energy of an uncatalyzed reaction with an enzyme-mediated reaction using a diagram.</li>
            <li>I can investigate the factors that affect enzyme function and use that data to draw conclusions about the key components of enzyme functionality in living systems.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Task 1: Introduction to Enzymes</h2>
